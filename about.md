My name is Tibor TÃ³th. I'm a software developer and engineer living in Hungary.

I've been making business applications for over ten years mostly on Microsoft
platform, but I also love open source things.

The goal of this site is to record and share some useful tips from varied
topics, mostly from the IT world.

This site is using [Jekyll][jekyll] with [EasyBook][theme] theme and
[Github pages][github-pages].

[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[jekyll]:    http://jekyllrb.com
[theme]: http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/easybook/
